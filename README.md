# MUCG

Program for calculation of TTT diagrams in steels

Program is enhanced version of MUCG46 and MUCG83 with possibility to use additional elements for chemical composition 
(C, Si, Mn, Ni, Mo, Cr, V, Co, Cu, Al, W and Fe which is calculated) from  MUCG83 and calculates martensite start temperature 
as a function of chemical composition, prior austenite grain size, external stress and pre-strain as in MUCG46. Composition 
is entered in wt%, grain size in micrometers  with default grain size 40 micrometers. Tensile or compressive pre-stress and 
pre-strain are entered in MPa and mm/mm, respectively. Allowable composition range limits are outputted before number needs 
to be entered to the screen. All input and output from the program are to the screen and TTT diagram can be constructed from 
output and widmanstatten start temperatures, growth limited bainite start temperature and martensite start temperature are 
given for entered conditions at the end.

Keywords: Widmanstatten, bainite, martensite, start temperatures
